#Overview
Use this repository get started with gulp utilizing `sass`, `autoprefixer`, `uglify`, `concat`. Have fun!

This project contains a pretty nifty "assets" folder structure and will do the following:
* compile SASS to CSS
* use `autoprefixer` to cover browser backwards compatibility
* combine and uglify all JavaScript files (except those in ./assets/js/libraries)
